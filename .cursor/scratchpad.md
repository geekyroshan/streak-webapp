# GitHub Streak Manager - Landing Page Improvement Plan

## Background and Motivation
The current landing page has a clean design with cards explaining key features, but it appears somewhat basic and has contrast issues, particularly with the "Backdate Commits" card which has light background affecting text visibility. We need to enhance the visual appeal and user experience without making it messy.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. The "Backdate Commits" card is using a light background (variant="opaque"), causing text visibility issues.
2. The landing page could benefit from more visual interest and modern design elements.
3. Need to maintain readability and clear communication while enhancing aesthetics.
4. The current layout is functional but could be more engaging and impressive for first-time visitors.
5. The background color doesn't complement the cards and text well, creating a visual disconnect.
